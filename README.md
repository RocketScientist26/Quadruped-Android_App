# Quadruped Android App

Android Studio project for Quadruped robot
- Ughly code, but works just flawless (I don't pretend to be Java programmer)
- Please note, for Voice Commands to work, you need internet connection or downloaded english offline text to speech dictionary in Android

App contains virtual joystick code based on [Damien Brun](https://github.com/makowildcat)'s ["virtual-joystick-android"](https://github.com/controlwear/virtual-joystick-android) library.
App contains Bluetooth library code based on [Cheuk-Wang Yau](https://github.com/MacroYau)'s ["Blue2Serial"](https://github.com/MacroYau/Blue2Serial) library.
Huge thanks to them for excellent Open Source work!
